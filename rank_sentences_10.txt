the Thompson \u201cno evidence\u201d rule, is likely to be erroneous.", "Having failed to identify the evil against which the rule is directed, and having failed to demonstrate how it follows from the analysis typically used in due process cases of this character, the Court places all of its reliance on a dry, and in my view incorrect, syllogism: If Winship requires the factfinder to apply a reasonable-doubt standard, then logic requires a reviewing judge to apply a like standard"]]], ["4393163", [["The case against him rested largely on the identification testimony of a witness to the crime.", "That witness had had five to six minutes at the crime scene to observe defendant in excellent lighting conditions at close range.", "After the lineup, the witness was shown a photograph of an arm with a tattoo, to which the witness responded that it appeared to be that of the assailant.", "At trial, defendant was instructed to show the jury and the witness his tattooed arm, exposed only to the extent that the arm of the robber had been exposed.", "The witness then made a positive identification of defendant as the robber.", "Defendant, on this appeal, while not challenging the identification procedure, claims that the evidence of his guilt was legally insufficient.", "He contends that the only reason that the witness was able to positively identify defendant, after having been shown defendant\u2019s arm again at trial, was that he had been shown a photograph of defendant\u2019s tattooed arm some six months before trial.", "The standard for reviewing the legal sufficiency of evidence in a criminal case is whether \u201cafter viewing the \u00e9vidence in the light most favorable to the prosecution, any rational trier of fact could have found the essential elements of the crime beyond a reasonable doubt\u201d (Jackson v Virginia, 443 US 307, 319 [emphasis in original]).", "Applying this standard, it cannot be said that the only rational inference that can be drawn from the witness\u2019s in-court identification of defendant after having viewed his tattooed arm, is that the identification was the result of having been shown a photograph of the tattooed arm, and not from his observations at the crime scene.", "On review of submissions pursuant to rule 500.2 (b) of the Rules of the Court of Appeals (22 NYCRR 500.2 [g]), order affirmed in a memorandum."]]]]
